At the end - culprit found to be SystemJS not compatible with Barrels. I found out that System JS doesn't work well with Barrels (using index.js) in Angular application.

It fails to resolve circular dependencies, and does not load modules properly when Barrels are used.

I could resolve it by not using Barrels to import objects, instead used full qualified path to JS files.
